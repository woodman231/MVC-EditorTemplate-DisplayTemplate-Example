    <p>This MVC App is to demonstrate the use of DisplayTemplate and EditorTemplates.</p>
    <p>Click <a asp-action="Index" asp-controller="People">here</a> to see it in action.</p>
    <p>DisplayTemplates and EditorTemplates are particularly useful when a project should share View code across multiple Views.</p>
    <p>DisplayTemplates are particularly useful for sharing code on the Details and Delete views.</p>
    <p>EditorTemplates are particularly useful for sharing code on the Create and Edit views.</p>
    <p>The trick is to create a "DisplayTemplate" and "EditorTemplate" folder underneath the Views -> Shared folder within the project.</p>
    <p>
        Once the folders are in place, Empty Views (cshtml) will need to be created with the name of the Model that will be passed in. <br />
        <img src="~/KeyFolderStructure.PNG" alt="Key Folder Structure" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Each View should have the @@model NameSpace.Models.ModelName that is being targetting for that view at the top, and then the rest of the code after that. <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="~/SampleDisplayTemplate.PNG" alt="Sample Display View" />
            <figcaption>Views\Shared\DisplayTemplates\Person.cshtml</figcaption>
        </figure>        
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the code is ready the @@Html.DisplayForModel() or @@Html.EditorForModel() can be placed in places within other views of a similar model would be displayed. <br />
        <figure>
            <img src="~/SampleDisplayForModel.PNG" alt="Sample DisplayForModel" />
            <figcaption>Views\People\Details.cshtml</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
    </p>
    <p>Now any changes made to the DisplayTemplate or EditorTemplate will be filled in on the views which were the @@Html.DisplayForModel() or @@Html.EditorForModel() were placed.</p>
    <p>In this example the Person DisplayTemplate is used on the Details and Delete Person Views. The Person EditorTemplate is used on the Create and Edit Person Views.</p>
